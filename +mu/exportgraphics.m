function exportgraphics(targets, varargin)
% This function is an extension of built-in function exportgraphics
% It aims to export multiple axes by creating a new figure and copying
% objects (your axes or panels) into that new figure.

newFig = figure("WindowState", "maximized");
pause(0.1); % wait for maximized
arrayfun(@(x) copyobj(x, newFig), targets);
exportgraphics(newFig, varargin{:});
close(newFig);
